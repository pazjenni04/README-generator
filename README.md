## **Description**
The objective of this application is to create a professional readme for the user.

## **Usage**
To use this application, the user first needs to type in node script.js in their terminal in visual studio code.  Once the user presses enter, they will then be prompted with the first question. 

![This image is a screenshot of the first question the user is prompted](images\first-question_image.PNG).  

Once the user responds to the question, they will then be prompted with the next series of questions that will complete the major sections of a professional README file.  If the user attempts to bypass a question, they will be prompted with a message saying that a response is needed to proceed. 

![This image is an example of the message the user is prompted with if they attempt to proceed without responding to the question](images\missed-response_image.PNG).  

Once the user answers all the questions, then a "Success!" message will be prompted within the terminal a new readme file will be created.
